    <h2>The History of Chess</h2>
    <p>
      Chess is one of the oldest and most intellectual games in the world. Its origins can be traced back
      nearly 1500 years to northern India, where it was known as <em>chaturanga</em>. The game spread to
      Persia, then to the Islamic world, and eventually reached Europe in the Middle Ages. By the 15th
      century, chess had evolved into the modern form we recognize today.
