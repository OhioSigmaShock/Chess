    <h2>Origins of Chess</h2>
    <p>Chess is one of the oldest known board games, with origins tracing back nearly 1,500 years. It is believed to have originated in India during the Gupta Empire, where it was called <em>Chaturanga</em>. The game later spread to Persia, where it became known as <em>Shatranj</em>. Through trade and conquest, chess reached the Islamic world and then medieval Europe, evolving into the modern version we know today by the 15th century.</p><div class="timeline">
